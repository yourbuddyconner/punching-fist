# Phase 1, Week 3 Status Report

## What We've Accomplished

### âœ… Week 1 Recap
- Created CRD definitions for Source, Workflow, and Sink
- Generated CRD YAML manifests (`deploy/crds/phase1-crds.yaml`)
- Updated Cargo.toml with required dependencies

### âœ… Week 2 Recap - Database Schema & Store Layer
- Created Phase 1 database migration with all required tables
- Implemented store models (Alert, Workflow, SourceEvent, etc.)
- Updated Store trait with Phase 1 interface
- Partial SQLite implementation with alert operations
- Fixed compilation issues

### âœ… Week 3 Progress - Source Handlers & Webhook Server

1. **Created Controllers Module** (`src/controllers/`)
   - Implemented SourceController that watches Source CRs
   - Reconciliation loop with status updates
   - Dynamic webhook registration based on Source specs
   - Proper error handling and requeue logic

2. **Created Sources Module** (`src/sources/`)
   - Implemented WebhookHandler for AlertManager integration
   - AlertManager webhook payload parsing
   - Alert filtering based on Source configuration
   - Alert fingerprinting and deduplication
   - Source event creation and storage

3. **Updated Webhook Server** (`src/server/routes.rs`)
   - Refactored webhook_alerts handler to use WebhookHandler
   - Dynamic path-based webhook routing
   - Proper error responses for unconfigured webhooks

4. **Integration in Main** (`src/main.rs`)
   - Created WebhookHandler on startup
   - Spawned SourceController in Kubernetes mode
   - Wired webhook_handler to Server

5. **Created Example Resources**
   - Example Source CRD for AlertManager (`deploy/examples/source-alertmanager.yaml`)
   - Demonstrates severity and alertname filtering

## Current Project State

### What's Working
- CRD definitions compile and generate valid YAML
- Database schema supports full Phase 1 requirements
- Store models align with new architecture
- SQLite alert operations implemented
- Source controller watches and reconciles Source CRs
- Webhook handler processes AlertManager webhooks
- Alert deduplication via fingerprinting
- Dynamic webhook endpoint registration
- Project builds successfully with all Week 3 components

### What Needs Implementation
- Authentication support for webhooks (bearer token validation)
- Complete SQLite store implementation (workflows, steps, sinks, etc.)
- PostgreSQL store implementation
- Workflow controller and engine (Week 4)
- LLM agent runtime (Week 5)
- Sink handlers (Week 6)
- Workflow triggering from webhook handler

## Architecture Decisions for Week 3

1. **Dynamic Webhook Registration**: WebhookHandler maintains a registry of webhook configs, updated by SourceController
2. **Alert Fingerprinting**: SHA256 hash of alertname + sorted labels for consistent deduplication
3. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - SourceController manages CRDs and configuration
   - WebhookHandler processes incoming webhooks
   - Store layer handles persistence
4. **Flexible Filtering**: HashMap-based filters allow any label-based filtering

## Next Steps for Week 4: Workflow Engine Core

1. **Create Workflow Controller**
   - Watch Workflow CRs
   - Manage workflow lifecycle

2. **Implement Workflow Engine**
   - State machine for workflow execution
   - Step executor framework
   - Context passing between steps

3. **Step Types Implementation**
   - CLI step executor
   - Agent step placeholder
   - Conditional step evaluator

4. **Workflow Triggering**
   - Connect webhook handler to workflow engine
   - Pass alert context to workflows

5. **Status Updates**
   - Update Workflow CR status
   - Track step execution progress

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Module Organization**: Clean separation between controllers, sources, and existing code
2. **Store Trait Methods**: Aligned webhook handler with existing store trait methods
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Used axum's wildcard path matching for flexible webhook paths
4. **Compilation Issues**: Fixed all import and visibility issues

## Metrics & Testing

### Code Quality
- All code compiles without errors
- Minimal warnings (mostly unused imports from old code)
- Proper error handling throughout

### Test Coverage Needed
- Unit tests for alert fingerprinting
- Integration tests for webhook processing
- Controller reconciliation tests
- End-to-end webhook â†’ alert flow

## Timeline Status

- Week 1: âœ… Complete (CRD definitions)
- Week 2: âœ… Complete (Store layer foundation)
- Week 3: âœ… Complete (Source handlers & webhook server)
- Week 4: ðŸ”„ Starting next (Workflow engine)
- Week 5: ðŸ“… Planned (LLM agent runtime)
- Week 6: ðŸ“… Planned (Sink handlers & integration)

## Week 3 Summary

We successfully implemented the source handling layer of the Phase 1 architecture:
- **Source Controller**: Kubernetes controller pattern for managing Source CRs
- **Webhook Handler**: Robust AlertManager webhook processing with filtering
- **Alert Lifecycle**: Proper alert creation, deduplication, and state management
- **Integration**: All components properly wired together in main.rs

The foundation is now ready for Week 4's workflow engine implementation!
