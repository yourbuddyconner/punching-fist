# Phase 1, Week 6 Milestone: End-to-End Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Milestone: MVP Pipeline Validation

We've successfully implemented all Phase 1 components:
- âœ… CRD definitions (Week 1)
- âœ… Database layer (Week 2)  
- âœ… Source handlers & webhook (Week 3)
- âœ… Workflow engine (Week 4)
- âœ… LLM agent runtime with Rig (Week 5)
- âœ… Stdout sink (Week 6)

## The Complete Pipeline is Ready!

```
AlertManager/Test â†’ Webhook â†’ Source â†’ Workflow â†’ Agent (LLM + Tools) â†’ Sink (stdout)
```

## What's Ready for Testing

### 1. **Deployment via Helm**
All resources are managed through the Helm chart:
- CRDs deployed separately (`deploy/crds/phase1-crds.yaml`)
- Operator deployment with configurable providers
- Test workloads automatically created
- Prometheus monitoring included

### 2. **Test Infrastructure**
- `test-resources/send-test-alert.sh` - Interactive alert generator
- `examples/test-stdout-pipeline.yaml` - Complete test pipeline  
- `test-resources/README.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- Pre-configured test pods simulating real issues

### 3. **Alert Scenarios**
Ready-to-test scenarios:
- **PodCrashLooping**: Investigates crashing pods
- **HighCPUUsage**: Analyzes CPU resource issues
- **HighMemoryUsage**: Examines memory problems

### 4. **Agent Capabilities**
The LLM agent can:
- Execute kubectl commands safely
- Query Prometheus metrics
- Analyze logs and pod states
- Generate root cause analysis
- Provide actionable recommendations

## Next Steps for Testing

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Set your API key in .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# 2. Deploy everything
just test-deploy

# 3. Apply test resources
kubectl apply -f examples/test-stdout-pipeline.yaml

# 4. Port forward
just test-port-forward-operator

# 5. Send test alert
./test-resources/send-test-alert.sh
```

### What to Validate

1. **Alert Reception**
   - Webhook receives AlertManager-format payloads
   - Alerts are stored in SQLite database
   - Source filtering works correctly

2. **Workflow Execution**
   - Workflows trigger automatically from sources
   - Agent steps execute with proper context
   - Tools (kubectl, promql) work as expected

3. **Investigation Quality**
   - Agent correctly identifies issues
   - Root cause analysis is accurate
   - Recommendations are actionable

4. **Output Formatting**
   - Stdout sink displays readable results
   - Template rendering works properly
   - All workflow outputs are captured

## Success Metrics

The MVP is successful if:
- âœ… Complete pipeline executes end-to-end
- âœ… Agent investigates alerts autonomously
- âœ… Results provide useful insights
- âœ… No manual intervention required
- âœ… System is stable and performant

## Beyond MVP

Once testing is successful, Phase 2 priorities:
1. **Production Sinks**: Slack, AlertManager annotation
2. **Alert Correlation**: Group related alerts into incidents
3. **Auto-Resolution**: Safe automated fixes
4. **Learning System**: Remember successful investigations
5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Local LLMs, alternative clouds

## Documentation Updates

Remember to update `DESIGN.md` with:
- âœ… Helm deployment architecture (already added!)
- Test results and learnings
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations

## The Big Picture

We've built a foundation that can:
- **Today**: Investigate alerts and provide insights
- **Tomorrow**: Auto-resolve simple issues
- **Future**: Learn patterns and prevent incidents

**Ready to test!** ðŸš€ The complete Phase 1 MVP pipeline is implemented and waiting for validation.
