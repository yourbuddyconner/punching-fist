# Phase 1, Week 3 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Goal: Source Handlers & Webhook Server

### ✅ What We Built

1. **Source Controller** (`src/controllers/source.rs`)
   - Kubernetes controller that watches Source CRs
   - Dynamically registers webhook endpoints based on Source specs
   - Updates Source status with ready state

2. **Webhook Handler** (`src/sources/webhook.rs`)
   - Processes AlertManager webhook payloads
   - Filters alerts based on Source configuration (severity, alertname)
   - Implements alert deduplication using fingerprinting
   - Creates alerts and source events in the database

3. **Updated Server Routes** (`src/server/routes.rs`)
   - Refactored webhook endpoint to use dynamic path matching
   - Integrated with WebhookHandler for alert processing

4. **Main Integration** (`src/main.rs`)
   - Creates WebhookHandler on startup
   - Spawns SourceController in background (Kubernetes mode)
   - Passes webhook handler to server

### 🔧 Key Features Implemented

- **Alert Deduplication**: SHA256 fingerprint of alertname + labels
- **Dynamic Webhook Registration**: Source CRs automatically create webhook endpoints
- **Flexible Filtering**: Label-based filtering (severity, alertname, etc.)
- **Alert Lifecycle**: Proper state management (received → triaging → resolved)
- **Source Events**: Track all incoming events for audit trail

### 📝 Example Usage

1. Create a Source CR:
```yaml
apiVersion: punchingfist.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: alertmanager-critical
spec:
  type: webhook
  config:
    path: "/alerts/critical"
    filters:
      severity: ["critical", "warning"]
  triggerWorkflow: alert-triage-workflow
```

2. AlertManager sends webhook to: `http://operator:8080/webhook/alerts/critical`

3. Operator processes alerts, filters by severity, and stores in database

### 🚀 Ready for Week 4

The webhook infrastructure is now ready to trigger workflows. Week 4 will focus on:
- Building the workflow engine
- Connecting webhooks to workflow execution
- Implementing step executors

### 💡 Technical Highlights

- Clean separation of concerns (controller vs handler)
- Robust error handling and logging
- Follows Kubernetes controller patterns
- Type-safe AlertManager webhook parsing
- Efficient alert deduplication
