# Phase 1, Week 4 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Goal: Workflow Engine Core

### ✅ What We Built

1. **Workflow Controller** (`src/controllers/workflow.rs`)
   - Kubernetes controller that watches Workflow CRs
   - Manages workflow lifecycle (Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed)
   - Updates Workflow CR status with execution progress
   - Requeues workflows based on their state

2. **Workflow Engine** (`src/workflow/engine.rs`)
   - Core execution engine with state machine
   - Asynchronous workflow queue processing
   - Step-by-step execution with context passing
   - Error handling and status tracking
   - Database persistence for workflow state

3. **Step Executor** (`src/workflow/executor.rs`)
   - Executes different step types (CLI, Agent, Conditional)
   - CLI steps: Creates Kubernetes pods to run commands
   - Agent steps: Placeholder for Week 5 LLM implementation
   - Conditional steps: Evaluates simple conditions
   - Template rendering for dynamic commands

4. **Workflow Context** (`src/workflow/context.rs`)
   - Manages data flow between workflow steps
   - Stores step outputs for use in subsequent steps
   - Provides template context for variable substitution
   - JSON serialization for persistence

5. **Workflow State** (`src/workflow/state.rs`)
   - Simple state machine for workflow execution
   - States: Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed

```

### 🔧 Key Features Implemented

1. **Workflow Execution Pipeline**
   - Webhook → Alert → Workflow Trigger → Step Execution
   - Each step's output feeds into the next step's context
   - Template rendering with `{{path.to.value}}` syntax

2. **CLI Step Execution**
   - Creates Kubernetes pods with configurable images
   - Captures stdout/stderr from pod execution
   - Timeout handling (default 5 minutes per step)
   - Environment variable support

3. **Conditional Logic**
   - Simple condition evaluation (`path.to.value == expected`)
   - Supports string, boolean, and number comparisons
   - Then/else branching (execution in Week 5)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure with error propagation
   - Failed steps stop workflow execution
   - Error details stored in database and CR status

### 📝 Example Workflow Execution

1. **AlertManager webhook received**:
   ```json
   {
     "alerts": [{
       "labels": {
         "alertname": "HighCPU",
         "severity": "warning"
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

2. **Workflow triggered with context**:
   - Alert ID, name, and severity passed as annotations
   - Workflow queued for execution

3. **CLI step executes**:
   ```yaml
   - name: check-pod-status
     type: cli
     command: "kubectl get pod {{input.podName}} -o json"
   ```

4. **Step output captured**:
   - JSON output stored in context
   - Available for next steps as `{{outputs.check-pod-status}}`

### 🚀 Ready for Week 5

The workflow engine infrastructure is now ready for:
- LLM agent runtime implementation
- Tool execution within agent steps
- Multi-step reasoning loops
- Investigation result summarization

### 💡 Technical Highlights

1. **Async/Await Architecture**: Non-blocking workflow execution
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout with proper error handling
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between controller, engine, and executor
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new step types or execution backends
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging at each stage

### 🐛 Known Limitations (To Address)

1. **Agent Steps**: Currently placeholder - Week 5 will implement
2. **Workflow Inputs**: Need to pass alert data as workflow input context
3. **Step Dependencies**: No support for parallel steps yet
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Pod cleanup after execution needs implementation

### 📊 Testing Next Steps

1. Create test workflows for CLI execution
2. Verify webhook → workflow triggering
3. Test error scenarios and recovery
4. Validate template rendering

## Summary

Week 4 successfully delivered the core workflow execution engine! We now have:
- ✅ Workflow controller managing lifecycle
- ✅ Execution engine with queue processing  
- ✅ Step executors for different step types
- ✅ Context management for data flow
- ✅ Integration with webhook alerts

The foundation is solid and ready for Week 5's LLM agent implementation!
