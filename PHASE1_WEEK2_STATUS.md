# Phase 1, Week 2 Status Report

## What We've Accomplished

### âœ… Week 1 Recap
- Created CRD definitions for Source, Workflow, and Sink
- Generated CRD YAML manifests (`deploy/crds/phase1-crds.yaml`)
- Updated Cargo.toml with required dependencies

### âœ… Week 2 Progress - Database Schema & Store Layer

1. **Created Phase 1 Database Migration** (`migrations/20240401000000_phase1_schema.sql`)
   - Enhanced alerts table with Phase 1 fields (fingerprint, AI analysis, timing)
   - Added workflows table for execution tracking
   - Added source_events, workflow_steps, sink_outputs tables
   - Added custom_resources table for CRD storage
   - Created all necessary indexes

2. **Implemented New Store Models** (`src/store/models.rs`)
   - Alert with full lifecycle tracking
   - Workflow execution state
   - SourceEvent for webhook/chat/schedule events
   - WorkflowStep for step-by-step execution
   - SinkOutput for tracking notifications
   - CustomResource for CRD instances
   - Helper functions for alert fingerprinting

3. **Updated Store Trait** (`src/store/mod.rs`)
   - Complete Phase 1 interface with all CRUD operations
   - Alert deduplication support
   - Workflow lifecycle management
   - Custom resource storage

4. **Partial SQLite Implementation** (`src/store/sqlite.rs`)
   - Implemented all alert operations
   - Alert deduplication logic
   - Placeholder implementations for other entities

5. **Fixed Compilation Issues**
   - Added UUID error handling
   - Commented out old OpenHands/Task code for Phase 1 rewrite
   - Updated server module for new architecture
   - Build now completes successfully

## Current Project State

### What's Working
- CRD definitions compile and generate valid YAML
- Database migrations ready for Phase 1 schema
- Store models align with new architecture
- SQLite alert operations implemented
- Project builds successfully

### What Needs Implementation
- Complete SQLite store implementation (workflows, steps, sinks, etc.)
- PostgreSQL store implementation
- Source controllers (Week 3)
- Workflow engine (Week 4)
- LLM agent runtime (Week 5)
- Sink handlers (Week 6)

## Next Steps for Week 3: Source Handlers & Webhook Server

1. **Refactor Webhook Server**
   - Update `src/server/routes.rs` webhook_alerts handler
   - Parse AlertManager webhook payload format
   - Store alerts in database with fingerprinting

2. **Implement Source Controller**
   - Watch Source CRs
   - Set up webhook endpoints dynamically
   - Apply filters from Source configuration

3. **Alert Processing Pipeline**
   - Fingerprint generation for deduplication
   - Source event creation and storage
   - Workflow triggering logic

4. **Authentication**
   - Bearer token support for webhooks
   - Kubernetes RBAC integration

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Database**: Using UUIDs for all IDs, JSONB for flexible data storage
2. **Fingerprinting**: SHA256 hash of alert name + sorted labels
3. **Enums**: Strongly typed enums for statuses with string serialization
4. **Error Handling**: Added UUID error conversion to OperatorError
5. **Architecture**: Clean separation between old and new code for gradual migration

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **SQLite Performance**: May need optimization for high alert volumes
   - Mitigation: Indexes added, can migrate to PostgreSQL if needed

2. **Schema Evolution**: Phase 1 schema may need adjustments
   - Mitigation: Using migrations, can evolve schema safely

3. **Partial Implementation**: Some components stubbed out
   - Mitigation: Clear TODOs, focused on one component at a time

## Timeline Status

- Week 1: âœ… Complete
- Week 2: âœ… Complete (Store layer foundation ready)
- Week 3: ðŸ”„ Starting next (Source handlers)
- Week 4: ðŸ“… Planned (Workflow engine)
- Week 5: ðŸ“… Planned (LLM agent runtime)
- Week 6: ðŸ“… Planned (Sink handlers & integration)

We're on track for the 6-week Phase 1 timeline!
